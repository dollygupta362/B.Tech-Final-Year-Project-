## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced digital world, real-time communication platforms have become an essential part of remote interaction — whether for professional, educational, or personal purposes. However, many platforms are either too complex, paid, or lack privacy.

**EliteMeet** addresses this gap by offering a **lightweight**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** alternative that combines the power of the MERN stack with **WebRTC** for direct peer-to-peer video communication, especially tailored for users seeking **language exchange** or **virtual collaboration**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a secure and scalable video chat app using **MERN stack**
- Enable **1:1 real-time video calling** using **WebRTC**
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** and role management
- Ensure a smooth and responsive **frontend UI**
- Enable dynamic signaling through **Socket.IO**
- Support **cross-browser compatibility**
- Host the project publicly for easy access

---

## 💡 Project Significance

EliteMeet enhances how users connect remotely, especially those seeking **language partners**, **mentorship sessions**, or **casual real-time conversations**. Unlike many existing tools, it offers:
- **No plugin installations**
- **Direct peer-to-peer calling**
- **Customizable and expandable structure**
- A strong foundation for further features like group calling, screen sharing, and scheduling.

## 🧱 System Architecture

### 🌐 Frontend:
- Built using **React.js**
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**
- Interacts with WebRTC and Socket.IO
- Handles login, register, and video call UI

### 🛠️ Backend:
- Developed using **Node.js + Express.js**
- Connected to **MongoDB** via **Mongoose**
- Implements **JWT authentication**
- Manages signaling and session tokens

### 📞 Communication:
- Real-time video/audio via **WebRTC**
- Signal exchange handled using **Socket.IO**
